<p class="site-intro">
	A bunch of 4 maniacs and lazy ass puzzle enthusiasts with a highly sophisticated clientele. We particularly love making and breaking ciphers. We don't aim to achieve something constructive with this note. One of our guys - Skywalker wanted to put up a lame web note and tell the world that we exist so we have this. Some of our public work will probably be coming up below as posts.

You can decipher our email address using this text: <b>C2wacZMmg3S1AAGHbIBtt2FbGW5afy==</b>. Decode with Vigen√©re cipher using <b>electroencephalograph</b> as the key (with the plain alphabet) and then base64 decode the output.
